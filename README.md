# Abfs.RefereeTools

This is a small project to explore Blazor technology. This projet is a small toolbox for National Referee in Belgium. 

It's allow users to :
- See all Belgian nation futsal team for the A.B.F.S. federation
- Calculate movement fees
- Add multilingual support (FR, NL & EN)
- Add hall's details to get an repository with all halls in Belgium and supported by the federation

## Roadmap

This is the vision, I have to evolve the toolbox : 

- Add a complete list referees to make easier the fees calculator
- Add authentication for access to referee (need an api to check the credential or maybe use external Auth0 to make it)
- Add all referees information to get an repository of referees in order to reach them.
- Add a color clothes library to easy 2 referees matches matching.
